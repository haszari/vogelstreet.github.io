Weâ€™ve invited some world famous artists at the top of their game to join a team of incredibly talented local and national artists to beautify walls across the southern part of the central city.

From __October 12 - 22__ you will have the opportunity to witness their work unfold, take shape and form compelling pieces of art.

The Dunedin Street Art Festival will create a unique, world-class street trail through the Warehouse Precinct and adjoining areas. Large walls on main streets to small spaces nestled in alleyways will be transformed into eye-catching murals representing our past, present and future.

Keep up to date with artist announcements by following the [Dunedin Street Art](https://www.facebook.com/dunedinstreetart) facebook page.
