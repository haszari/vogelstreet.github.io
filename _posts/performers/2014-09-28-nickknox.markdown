[Nick Knox](http://nicknoxmusic.wordpress.com) is a composer, pianist and singer from Dunedin, NZ. He is fascinated by, and driven to explore, aspects of __divinity__, __spirituality__ and __transcendence__ through music. His work is at once soulful, gruff and delicate; often laced with baroque sensibilities.
