Underworld Puppetry is based on three dark and fascinating tales from the Brothers Grimm.  

The show was successfully premiered at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery for Midwinter. It includes giant puppets in Godfather Death, a shadow puppet play of The Devil and his Grandmother, and glove puppets in The Theft of the Moon. 

Featuring live early music by the Rare Byrds, and puppetry by the Dunedin Medieval Society and special guests. Suitable for all ages.
