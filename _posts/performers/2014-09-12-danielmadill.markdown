Daniel Madill combines acoustic guitar and vocals with electronica to create folk music with a contemporary feel. He has been influenced by the lo fi approach of the ‘Dunedin Sound’ and growing up amongst the local folk music scene. Daniel released his debut album, _Submariner's Dilemma_ in 2013 and toured the South Island. He is currently working on a second album.
