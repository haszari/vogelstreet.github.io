Junglefari is Dunedin's premier dub selector. Listen in to his Roots & Culture show 5-7 pm Saturdays on [Radio 1 91 FM](http://www.mixcloud.com/tag/junglefari/). 

Or catch him on tour with international sound systems. Otherwise he can be found digging through the crates to bring you exclusive reggae vibes.
