The Drop Shop was born from a culture of shattered electro dreams and late nights on the decks. 

A joint passion for the House & Electronic music scene originally bought this collective together as students in Dunedin. Now down to just one remaining winner that wonâ€™t hang up the headphones - pants, beats, or ya grandma, The Drop Shop will throw down to ensure you get a groove on.
