Learn how to make your own LED light art by putting together a [LED throwie](http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies/) with the team from [Dspace](/dspace). 

Help us light up the giant VOGEL sign by adding your LED throwie to it, or take it home and put it inside a balloon or transparent object to make it glow.
