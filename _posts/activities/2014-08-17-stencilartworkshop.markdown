A stencil art workshop especially designed for children. Workshop participants will learn the basic techniques and processes used by street artists by creating their own stencil artwork. 

Each child will recieve an A4 canvas to spray-paint pre-cut stencils that reference the history of the Warehouse Precinct. At the end of their session, they will be able to take their canvas home with them.
