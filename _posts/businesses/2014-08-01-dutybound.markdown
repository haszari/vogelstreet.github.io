[Dutybound](http://dutybounddunedin.wordpress.com) is the premises and workshop of David Stedman, a bookbinder, designer and restorer of books and print-related materials.

Dutybound is unique in that it is an authentic working bindery which uses vintage equipment to create bespoke goods for a wide range of customers. Based in the original _John McIndoe Printers_ bindery where David served his apprenticeship, Dutybound is home to intriguing old printing and bookbinding equipment which is still used to hand craft books and items today. He also has extensive experience in book repair and preservation.

A recent development is that one of the very few Intertype machines left in the South Island is now proudly displayed in the front window; its mysterious appearance has attracted a lot of attention recently, it's not widely known that the machine revolutionised printing.

Take the opportunity to visit Dutybound during the Vogel Street Party to see the Dunedin School of Art's installation _La Morgue des Oeuvres_ â€“ _the Book Morgue_; purchase from the unique range of handmade blank journals, notebooks and albums; and experience the working bindery. Watch out for special promotions on the day.
