Sean Duffel aka [Ghstie](http://ghstie.com) is a Wellington based muralist whose distinctly colourful style is well recognised throughout New Zealand. His older character-based work, which can be spotted in various spaces around Dunedin, has morphed into an interpretation of the natural world in New Zealand, providing vibrantly graphic abstract murals with which local communities can connect.
