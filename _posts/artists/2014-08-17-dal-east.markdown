Chinese artist [DALeast](http://www.daleast.com)  studied sculpture before joining the JEJ graffiti crew in China and this background can be seen in the three dimensional nature of his street art. His distinctive pieces look as if they have been constructed using shards of metal to create the frenetic shape of animals and people. He started working on the street in 2004 and birds have become a reoccurring theme in his murals seen in Europe, Africa and North America. 

DALeast was inspired to paint a menacing Haast’s Eagle during his visit to Dunedin after a trip to the Otago Museum. This large scale piece took three days to complete with the assistance of a local cherry picker. The now extinct Haast’s Eagle was the largest eagle to have ever existed and was found only in the South Island of New Zealand where its diet would have included the South Island Giant Moa. The skeleton at the Otago Museum is the most complete skeleton of the bird on display in the world.
