Be Free creates architectural interventions in Melbourne, Australia. Characterised by the use of bright colours, playing cards and a young girl with stripy socks and sneakers, Be Freeâ€™s innovative and fresh take on mural art provides a visually exciting and playful addition to the street art scene.
